[What is Outsourcing Software Development?](https://www.manifera.com/what-is-outsourcing-software-development/)

As a student, I have always seen the development process from the perspective of the coder. Since this field is growing in the workforce (as mentioned in class), there would be a lot of demand but there would also be many other developers as well . Through this article, I wanted to learn what potential clients would want out of a developer to appear more appealing to them. The article leans towards software firms, which depending on the firm, would provide various services to the client. These include: "mobile application and web development services", the domains of: "Artificial Intelligence, Robotic Process Automation, and Cloud Computing". Additionally, their services are customisable to the customer's demand, adding flexibility as a factor to consider. Overall, the best chance for work in outsourcing would be joining a firm that offers competitive rates for high quality work.

I really enjoyed reading this article as well, as it provided me with a lot of new insights about the future of software engineering. I am curious to learn more about how companies have experimented with onshore and offshore outsourcing, and the impacts of each on productivity. Further, I would love to learn more about how the option to outsource software development will impact business' decision making structures.
