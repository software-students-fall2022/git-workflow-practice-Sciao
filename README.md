[What is Outsourcing Software Development?](https://www.manifera.com/what-is-outsourcing-software-development/)

As a student, I have always seen the development process from the perspective of the coder. Since this field is growing in the workforce (as mentioned in class), there would be a lot of demand but there would also be many other developers as well . Through this article, I wanted to learn what potential clients would want out of a developer to appear more appealing to them. The article leans towards software firms, which depending on the firm, would provide various services to the client. These include: "mobile application and web development services", the domains of: "Artificial Intelligence, Robotic Process Automation, and Cloud Computing". Additionally, their services are customisable to the customer's demand, adding flexibility as a factor to consider. Overall, the best chance for work in outsourcing would be joining a firm that offers competitive rates for high quality work. 



#### Comment by Alejandro Olazabal:

As time goes by technology is being more and more integrated in all forms of work. Companies either progress and adjust to technological trends or get left in the dust by their competitors. This idea of outsourcing software developemnt is really interesting because it gives any company the opportnunity to better there products by contracting software developers that arent necessarilly full time workers at the company. It gives company the flexibility to incorporate technology with their product, without having to invest a lot of resources in building a software/tech department. This article sparked my interest in perhaps, creating a software development agency and recruiting very talented developers so we can supply the need for these companies that are outsourcing.
